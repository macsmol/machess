Release 1:
-UCI
    -print info in correct format pv line nodes, current depth etc
    -timed moves - trivial
    -timed moves - iterative deepening with TT
-alpha-beta-pruning
-TODOs in code
-oscillation when playing against itself (threefold repetition draw)

Later:
-try out incremental check-flags update
-improve evaluation (piece-square table, pins, pawn structure)


LATER IDEAS:
-init sliding-checks around king and pins in one loop OR init pins per sliding piece, not per direction.

--testing git - can't push that directly to master?
