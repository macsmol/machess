Release 1:
-UCI
    -print info in correct format pv line nodes, current depth etc
    -timed moves
        -break when getting stop from gui
        -don't do iterative deepening when found winning PV
        -break out of minmax when found winning PV (will this work in AB-pruning?)
        -log pv and info more often
        -timed first, second.. N moves (like explained on https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/about.html)

    -timed moves - iterative deepening with TT
-alpha-beta-pruning
-TODOs in code

Later:
-try out incremental check-flags update
-improve evaluation (piece-square table, pins, pawn structure)


LATER IDEAS:
-init sliding-checks around king and pins in one loop OR init pins per sliding piece, not per direction.

--testing git - can't push that directly to master?
