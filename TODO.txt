Release 1:
-quiescence search!
    -nps fix
    -don't generate all and filter, just generate less
    -better move ordering
    -worse than ptf in 4 mins - why?
-better mobility evaluation (less points for stronger pieces)
-UCI
    -timed moves
        -break when getting stop from gui (move worker to another thread?)
-transposition table
-clearTODOs in code
-perft test case for tricky ep with pin

Bugs:
-minor: fix invalid PVs reported in pgns from Arena (due to scrapping results of unfinished iterative deepening runs)
