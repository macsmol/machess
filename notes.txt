-Move as int is slower than moves as State instances. Looks like java is good at GC.

-checked fields optimization was tricky due to king castlings.

-Catching assertionErrors in minmax, logging state and rethrowing looks like a good idea. Normal/conditionall breakpoints don't really work because of geometric growth.
At 5 plies depth generateLegalMoves() breaks ~2000000 times.
